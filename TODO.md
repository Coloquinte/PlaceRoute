## Features

*   Timing-driven placement: integrate timing-driven placement with a callback
*   Routing-driven placement: integrate routing-driven placement with a callback

## Ease-of-development

*   More randomization:
    *   Make the detailed placer less deterministic
    *   Randomize lower-bound and upper-bound positions

*   Configuration handling:
    *   Expose an help message for the options
    *   Organize options hierarchically

## Performance

*   Optimization for various quality/time tradeoffs
*   Parallel implementation for detailed placement
*   Legalization cost models other than L1
*   Reoptimization in legalization
