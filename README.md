# Coloquinte Place&Route

Coloquinte is a Place&Route tool for electronic circuits.

Individual steps in Place&Route are well understood, but their interaction is fragile.
Co-design of Place&Route algorithms is necessary to get more robust and performant tools.
Coloquinte's aim is to provide a single package of well-tested and well-tuned Place&Route algorithms, to be used in open source CAD chains.
